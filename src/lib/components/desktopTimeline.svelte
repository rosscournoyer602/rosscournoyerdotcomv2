				The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
				I got about fifty feet out and suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell you he
				was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow.
				I said, "Easy, big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling, I realized that something
				was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing, I could see directly into the eye
				of the great fish.
